# Architect’s Notebook

This repository captures how I think, decide, and reason
as a Test Architect and Quality Engineer.

It focuses on:
- Architectural decisions and trade-offs
- Testing and quality patterns that scale
- Failures, learnings, and corrections
- Interview-ready explanations grounded in real practice

This is not tool documentation.
This is documentation of judgment.
