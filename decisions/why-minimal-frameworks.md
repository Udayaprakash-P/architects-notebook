# Why I Avoid Overbuilding Test Frameworks

## Observation
Most automation frameworks fail due to complexity,
not lack of features.

## Decision
Start with minimal structure and evolve abstractions
only after duplication appears.

## Rationale
- Improves readability
- Reduces onboarding time
- Avoids premature abstractions

## Outcome
Framework remains maintainable and intentional.
