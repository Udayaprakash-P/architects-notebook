# Why Risk-Based Testing

## Problem
Automating everything increases maintenance cost
and slows down CI pipelines without improving confidence.

## Decision
Focus automation on high-risk business flows.

## Rationale
- Faster feedback
- Better signal-to-noise ratio
- Direct impact on production risk

## Trade-offs
- Lower perceived coverage
- Requires domain understanding

## Outcome
Higher release confidence with fewer tests.
